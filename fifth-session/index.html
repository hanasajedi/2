     swear by the quiet silence of your paper house, I know your dreams are as beautiful as my fancies believable. 
     You've got the mystic believe of love from my silence. I've got the final point of belief from your silence. Maybe it's not possible to feel 
     that the words we say about the paper world we've made are hearable. But we can start to paint the gray branches of the paper trees green.
     I know painting, you know painting too. So why don't you start? When I was a child, I didn't have any water color. 
     I used to go to little garden near stream and cut all the color flowers and paint. If we search the paper garden near paper house for a short time,
      there have to be flowers to paint our 
      HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a type of markup language.[1] It is used to make webpages. Webpages can include writing, links, pictures,
       and even sound and video. HTML tells web browsers what webpages should look like. HTML also adds meta information to webpages.
        Meta information is information about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Web browsers usually do not show meta information.

HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. CSS is used to change the way HTML looks.
 JavaScript tells websites how to behave. It can also change HTML and CSS.

HTML is made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are many versions of HTML. As of September 2018, 
the current standard of HTML is called HTML 5 and is specifically at version 5.2.
HTML uses "elements" to let the browser know how a webpage is made of. Elements are shown as "tags" in the code, written with angle brackets: <example>. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag defines the start of
     a block of content and a closing tag defines the end of that block of content. There are many kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose. See Basic HTML Tags below for tag examples.

    Some tags only work in certain browsers. For example, the <menuitem> tag, which is used to make something appear when the person presses the right button of the mouse, only works on the Mozilla Firefox browser.[2] Other browsers simply ignore this tag and display the writing normally.
     Many web page creators avoid using these "non-standard" tags because they want their pages to look the same with all browsers
     January 14, 1997
HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16]
Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.
HTML 4
December 18, 1997
HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.
Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[19]
April 24, 1998
HTML 4.0[20] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
December 24, 1999
HTML 4.01[21] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata[22] were published on May 12, 2001.
May 2000
ISO/IEC 15445:2000[23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.[24] In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).[23]
After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.
HTML 5

October 28, 2014
HTML5[25] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[26]
November 1, 2016
HTML 5.1[27] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[28][29]
December 14, 2017
HTML 5.2[30] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[31][32]
HTML draft version timeline
October 1991
HTML Tags,[6] an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML tags, was first mentioned in public.
June 1992
First informal draft of the HTML DTD,[33] with seven subsequent revisions (July 15, August 6, August 18, November 17, November 19, November 20, November 22)[34][35][36]
November 1992
HTML DTD 1.1 (the first with a version number, based on RCS revisions, which start with 1.1 rather than 1.0), an informal draft[36]
June 1993
Hypertext Markup Language[37] was published by the IETF IIIR Working Group as an Internet Draft (a rough proposal for a standard). It was replaced by a second version[38] one month later.
November 1993
HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet Draft and was a competing proposal to the Hypertext Markup Language draft. It expired in July 1994.[39]
November 1994
First draft (revision 00) of HTML 2.0 published by IETF itself[40] (called as "HTML 2.0" from revision 02[41]), that finally led to the publication of RFC 1866 in November 1995.[42]
April 1995 (authored March 1995)
HTML 3.0[43] was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months later (28 September 1995)[44] without further action. It included many of the capabilities that were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow around figures, and the display of complex mathematical formulas.[44]
W3C began development of its own Arena browser as a test bed for HTML 3 and Cascading Style Sheets,[45][46][47] but HTML 3.0 did not succeed for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.[13] Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.[13] (see Browser wars). These included extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things as text color, background texture, font size, and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be organized."[13] Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years, has commented for example: "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the 
Web by extending HTML
